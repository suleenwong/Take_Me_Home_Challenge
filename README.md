# Take me home challenge

## Introduction:
A Data Scientist should possess strong analytical skills as well as experience building software and strong communication skills. This technical challenge covers all three of these components using a sample data set. The data set is about students. The data set includes information about the studentsâ€™ age, nationality, gender, as well as information about their studying habits. There is also a binary column expressing whether or not the students passed an important test.

This challenge consists of three parts:

### Part 1: Analysis
- Describe the demographic details of people most likely to pass the test
- Describe the efficacy of the two interventions - the test prep course and the Dojo class
- Identify any other interesting trends from the data set and offer some analysis as to their importance or cause.

### Part 2: Model Creation
- Create a model that can predict whether or not a student will pass the test. Use the provided data set to train your model and test its accuracy. You have free choice of programming language, algorithm, and tools.

### Part 3: Reporting
- The goal in the final stage is to communicate your findings to less technical management staff. There are two requirements:
- Create visualizations to show the efficacy of your model. A non-data scientist should be able to infer at a glance how well it fits the data.
- Offer ideas for how we might help more people pass the test and create more accurate models based on your findings. Summarize with bullet points and consider adding more visuals.


## Requirements:
There is a requirements.txt file with a list of all the packages and dependencies you will need.

To install the environment you can use the following commands in the terminal:

```zsh
pyenv local 3.9.8
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or alternatively, use the Makefile:
```zsh
make setup
source .venv/bin/activate
```
